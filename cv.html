  <h2>Lucretia E. McGuff-Silverman</h2>
  <img id="profilePic" src="./img/human/profile.jpg">
  <p>Ellen has lived in Roosevelt, New Jersey since 1990.  The rural nature of the town is reflected in her paintings of landscapes as well as her fascination with color and how light affects it. She uses that play of color and light to portray her reaction to her world.
  </p>

  <p>The style of the acrylic paintings is impressionistic with bright colors.
  </p>
  <p>She has a MFA in Oil Painting, from American University.  Her work has been exhibited in regional galleries, one person and juries shows.
